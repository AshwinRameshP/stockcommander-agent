# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Inventory Replenishment Agent is an AI-powered system that analyzes bulk sales and purchase invoices to automatically generate optimized spares inventory replenishment recommendations. The system leverages machine learning to identify demand patterns, supplier performance metrics, and seasonal trends to predict optimal reorder points, quantities, and timing for spare parts inventory management.

This agent addresses the critical business challenge of maintaining optimal inventory levels while minimizing carrying costs and stockout risks. By processing historical invoice data and applying predictive analytics, the system enables proactive inventory management decisions that improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a warehouse manager, I want the system to automatically analyze my sales invoice data, so that I can understand demand patterns for spare parts without manual data processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bulk sales invoice files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract and parse invoice line items including part numbers, quantities, dates, and customer information
2. WHEN invoice data is processed THEN the system SHALL identify unique spare part SKUs and aggregate demand quantities over time periods
3. WHEN demand analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL calculate key metrics including average monthly demand, demand variability, and seasonal trends for each spare part
4. IF invoice format is unrecognized THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest supported formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a procurement specialist, I want the system to analyze purchase invoice data, so that I can track supplier performance and cost trends for informed sourcing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN purchase invoice files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract supplier information, part costs, delivery dates, and order quantities
2. WHEN supplier data is processed THEN the system SHALL calculate supplier performance metrics including lead times, price trends, and delivery reliability
3. WHEN cost analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify the most cost-effective suppliers for each spare part category
4. WHEN supplier performance varies significantly THEN the system SHALL flag suppliers with declining performance metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an inventory planner, I want AI-powered replenishment recommendations, so that I can maintain optimal stock levels while minimizing carrying costs and stockouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demand and supplier data is available THEN the system SHALL use machine learning algorithms to predict future demand for each spare part
2. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate optimal reorder points based on lead times, demand variability, and service level targets
3. WHEN reorder calculations are complete THEN the system SHALL recommend specific quantities and timing for each replenishment order
4. WHEN inventory levels approach reorder points THEN the system SHALL automatically generate purchase recommendations with preferred suppliers
5. IF demand patterns change significantly THEN the system SHALL adjust recommendations and alert users to the changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want real-time inventory monitoring and alerts, so that I can prevent stockouts and optimize working capital allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is operational THEN it SHALL provide a dashboard showing current inventory levels, pending orders, and upcoming replenishment needs
2. WHEN inventory levels fall below safety stock THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts via email or API notifications
3. WHEN seasonal demand patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL proactively recommend inventory adjustments 2-3 months in advance
4. WHEN cost savings opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL quantify potential savings and recommend specific actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to integrate with existing business systems, so that inventory data stays synchronized across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration is configured THEN the system SHALL connect to ERP systems via REST APIs to retrieve current inventory levels
2. WHEN replenishment orders are approved THEN the system SHALL automatically create purchase orders in the connected ERP system
3. WHEN external inventory management systems are available THEN the system SHALL sync inventory updates in real-time
4. IF API connections fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide manual data export options
5. WHEN data synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails of all inventory transactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities, so that I can measure the effectiveness of inventory optimization strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate detailed analytics on inventory turnover, carrying costs, and stockout incidents
2. WHEN performance metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL compare actual vs. predicted demand accuracy and recommendation effectiveness
3. WHEN cost analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL quantify savings achieved through optimized replenishment strategies
4. WHEN trend analysis is conducted THEN the system SHALL identify long-term patterns in demand, costs, and supplier performance
