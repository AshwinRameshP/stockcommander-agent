## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Run validation script
npm run validate:deployment

# Run pre-deployment checks
npm run pre-deploy
```

### 2. Deploy to Development
```bash
# Deploy to development environment
npm run deploy:dev

# Verify deployment
npm run test:smoke -- --env=dev
```

### 3. Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
npm run deploy:staging

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test:e2e -- --env=staging
npm run test:performance -- --env=staging

# Generate deployment report
npm run generate:deployment-report -- --env=staging
```

### 4. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Final validation
npm run validate:deployment

# Deploy to production (requires approval)
npm run deploy:production

# Monitor deployment health
npm run monitor:deployment-health -- --env=production --timeout=300

# Verify deployment
npm run test:smoke -- --env=production
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Immediate Verification (0-15 minutes)
- [ ] Application health checks pass
- [ ] All critical endpoints responding
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] External integrations functioning
- [ ] Error rates within acceptable limits
- [ ] Response times within SLA

### ðŸ“Š Extended Monitoring (15-60 minutes)
- [ ] Application performance metrics normal
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage stable
- [ ] No unusual error patterns in logs
- [ ] User traffic patterns normal
- [ ] Third-party service integrations stable

### ðŸ“ˆ Long-term Monitoring (1-24 hours)
- [ ] Business metrics tracking correctly
- [ ] Cost monitoring shows expected usage
- [ ] Security alerts configured and working
- [ ] Backup processes running successfully
- [ ] Log aggregation and retention working

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 5 seconds
- Availability < 95%

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Rollback infrastructure
npm run rollback:infrastructure -- --env=production

# Rollback frontend
npm run rollback:frontend -- --env=production

# Verify rollback
npm run test:smoke -- --env=production
```

### Rollback Checklist
